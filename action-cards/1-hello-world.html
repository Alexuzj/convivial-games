    <!-- This HTML code sets up a simple webpage structure. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration indicates it's using HTML5. Inside <html lang="en">, it specifies the document's language as English. The <head> section includes essential details like character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8" />) and viewport settings (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />). The <body> section holds the visible content of the webpage, which in this case cheerfully says "Hello World!".) -->
