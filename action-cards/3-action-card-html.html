      <p>Here's a 'DIV' element below! 
        A div element in HTML is a fundamental building block used to structure and organize content on a webpage. It acts like a container or a box that can hold other HTML elements like text, images, or other divs. By applying CSS styles to divs, you can control their appearance, layout, and positioning on the page, making them versatile for creating columns, sections, or entire layouts.</p>
